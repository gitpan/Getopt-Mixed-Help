Getopt-MixedHelp version 0.18
=============================

Getopt::Mixed::Help is a simplified interface to Getopt::Mixed adding
usage (help) functionality.  It automatically adds the options -?, -h
and --help (the last two configurable) to print the usage text.  It
allows to get option values from the environment (if the operating
system it runs on supports environment variables).  It can also add
different flavours of support for multiple options.  Finally it
supports debugging output of the options used.
