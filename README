Getopt-MixedHelp version 0.25
=============================

Getopt::Mixed::Help is a simplified interface to Getopt::Long adding
usage (help) functionality.  It automatically adds the options -?, -h
and --help (the last two configurable) to print the usage text.  It
allows to get option values from the environment (if the operating
system it runs on supports environment variables).  It can also add
different flavours of support for multiple options.  Finally it
supports debugging output of the options used.

Versions prior to 0.25 used Getopt::Mixed as their option parser,
therefore this module got its name.  As Getopt::Mixed has been
deprecated in favour of Getopt::Long which is now part of the standard
distribution, Getopt::Mixed::Help changed its base though not (yet)
its name.  See documentation for additional details.
